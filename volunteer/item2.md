COP26 Conference of the Parties 

Climate Change Convention 

Glasgow, Scotland 

31 October - 12 November, 2021 

The COP26 summit will bring parties together to move foward on the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework on Climate Change. Some of the highlights of the summit will include:
1) Countries represented by the parties are being asked to come forward with ambitious 2030 emission reductions targets or NDCs to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century.
2) Governments must work together to adapt to protect communities and natural habitats.
3) International financial institutions must play their part to unleash financial resources to secure global net zero emissions.
4) The implementation of the Paris Rulebook should be a "must" to implement the rules needed to implement the Paris Agreement.
